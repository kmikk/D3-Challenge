          <h2><center>Correlations Discovered Between<br>
            Median Income and Obesity</center></h2>
          <p>It is well known that poorer Americans are more likely to be obese or suffer from diabetes; 
            there is a strong negative correlation between household income and both obesity and diabetes. 
            This negative correlation, however, has only developed in the past 30 years, according to 
            researchers in Tennessee and London. Since 1990, the rise of obesity and diabetes was fastest 
            among the poorest U.S. regions, says Alexander Bentley of the University of Tennessee in the US. 
            The timing also fits with the generations exposed to high fructose corn syrup in foodstuffs and drinks, 
            says Bentley, who is the lead author of a study in the journal Palgrave Communications.</p>

            <p>Experts describe the unprecedented rise in obesity in recent history as the most rapid change ever 
              seen in human physiology. Only a century ago, obesity was a phenomenon almost unknown to citizens of 
              the US and other developed countries.</p>

            <p>"The data point to a developing trend that was not present in 1990. This negative correlation has evolved 
              steadily over recent decades," explains Bentley. "By 2015 the situation was such that members of lower 
              income households had a much greater chance of suffering from obesity and diabetes."</p>
